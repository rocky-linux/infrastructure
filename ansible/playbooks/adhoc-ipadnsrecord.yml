# This playbook is meant to be used with callable variables, like adhoc or AWX.
# What: Creates dns records in the idm infrastructure based on the variables
#       provided.
# What is expected:
#  -> ipaadmin_password: This should be the password of the admin user
#  -> ipa_admin: The admin user that has kerberos management capabilities (default is admin)
#  -> ipa_zone: The zone name (eg, rockylinux.org)
#  -> ipa_name: The shortname (eg, buildbox instead of buildbox.rockylinux.org)
#  -> ipa_name_type: Type of record (eg, CNAME, A, AAAA, PTR)
#  -> ipa_name_value: Record value (depends on type of record)
#  -> ipa_presence: present or absent
