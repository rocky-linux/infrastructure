# Ansible

Ansible playbooks, roles, modules, etc will come here. This wiki will reflect the layout, structure, and potential standards that should be followed when making playbooks and roles.

Each playbook should have comments or a name descriptor that explains what the playbook does or how it is used. If not available, README-... files can be used in place, especially in the case of adhoc playbooks that take input. Documentation for each playbook/role does not have to be on this wiki. Comments or README's should be sufficient.

## Management Node Structure

Loosely copied from the CentOS ansible infrastructure.

```

├── ansible.cfg
├── files -> playbooks/files
├── handlers -> playbooks/handlers
├── inventories
│   ├── production
│   |   ├── group_vars
│   |   ├── host_vars
│   |   hosts
│   ├── staging

│   ├── handlers
│   ├── tasks

├── roles/local
│   └── <role-name>

├── tasks -> playbooks/tasks

└── vars -> playbooks/vars
```

## Structure

What each folder represents

```
files      -> As the name implies, non-templated files go here. Files that are
              dropped somewhere on the file system should be laid out in a way
              that represents the file system (eg. ./etc/sysconfig/)
group_vars -> Group Variables go here if they are not fulfilled in an inventory.
              Recommended that group_vars be used over inventory vars.
host_vars  -> Host variables go here
inventory  -> All static inventories go here
roles      -> Custom roles can go here
tasks      -> Common tasks come here
templates  -> Templates go here
vars       -> Global variables that are called with vars_files go here. This
```

## Current Playbook Naming

```
init-* -> Starting infrastructure playbooks that run solo or import other
          playbooks that start with import-
adhoc  -> These playbooks are one-off playbooks that can be used on the CLI or
          in AWX. These are typically for basic tasks.
import -> Playbooks that should be imported from the top level playbooks
role-* -> These playbooks call roles specifically for infrastructure tasks.
          Playbooks that do not call a role should be named init or adhoc based
          on their usage.
```

## Designing Playbooks

### Pre flight and post flight

At a minimum, there should be `pre_tasks` and `post_tasks` that can judge whether ansible has been can or has been run on a system. Some playbooks will not necessarily need this (eg if you're running an adhoc playbook to create a user). But operations done on a host should at least have these in the playbook, with an optional handlers include.

```
  handlers:
    - include: handlers/main.yml

  pre_tasks:
    - name: Check if ansible cannot be run here
      stat:
        path: /etc/no-ansible
      register: no_ansible

    - name: Verify if we can run ansible
      assert:
        that:
          - "not no_ansible.stat.exists"
        msg: "/etc/no-ansible exists - skipping run on this node"

  # Import roles/tasks here

  post_tasks:
    - name: Touching run file that ansible has ran here
      file:
        path: /var/log/ansible.run
        state: touch
        mode: '0644'
        owner: root
        group: root
```

### Comments

Each playbook should have comments or a name descriptor that explains what the playbook does or how it is used. If not available, README-... files can be used in place, especially in the case of adhoc playbooks that take input. Documentation for each playbook/role does not have to be on this wiki. Comments or README's should be sufficient.

### Tags

Ensure that you use relevant tags where necessary for your tasks.

### Roles

If you are using roles that are not part of this repository in the `roles` directory, you will need to list them in the `requirements.yml`. For example, we use the IPA role.

```
---
- src: freeipa.ansible_freeipa
```

Otherwise, custom roles for the infrastructure will sit in `ansible/roles`.
